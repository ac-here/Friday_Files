# Friday_Files

This folder contains a set of basic algorithms that our lab uses to process physiological signals like pressure or ECG waveforms. We used MATLAB to implement these algorithms. Our group did not write all the codes, and as an academic courtesy, we have duly acknowledged the contributions of respective authors. Feel free to use/modify these algorithms to make them suitable for your project. If you like to help, contribute to this repository and "COMMIT" your modifications. 

At present, this project has subfolders dedicated to a specific task. For instance, there are folders with codes dedicated to detecting R waves of an ECG signal or detecting foot and peak pressure waveforms. Please note that each subfolder has a sample signal to test the code and a main.m file to help you with examples of using these basic processing algorithms in your project.

Enjoy.
