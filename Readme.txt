# Friday_Files

This folder contains a set of basic algorithms that our lab uses to process Physiological signals. We want to share all the codes that we use in our processing and welcome others to contribute to our effort. Our group did not write all the codes, and as an academic courtesy, we have duly acknowledged the contributions of respective authors. Feel free to use/modify these algorithms to make them suitable for your project. If you like to help, contribute to this repository and "COMMIT" your modifications. 

At present, this project has subfolders dedicated for a specific task like detect R waves of an ECG signal and detect foot and peak of pressure waveforms. In addition, each subfolder has a sample signal to test the code and a main.m file to help you with examples on how to use these basic processing algorithms in your project.

Enjoy.
